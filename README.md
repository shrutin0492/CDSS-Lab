# Compiler Design and System Software Lab
Programs as part of the Compiler Design and System Software Laboratory course in the 3rd year of my undergrad.

1. [(1a) Program to count the number of characters, words, spaces and lines in a given input file. (lex)](1a)

2. [(1b) Program to recognize and count the number of identifiers. (lex)](1b)

3. [(2a) Programs to count the numbers of single and multi comment lines in a given C program. Also 
eliminate them and copy the resulting program into separate file. (lex)](2a)

4. [(2b) Program to recognize whether a given sentence is simple or compound. (lex)](2b)

5. [(3a) Program to count the number of: (i) +ve and -ve integers, (ii) +ve and -ve fractions. (lex)](3a) 

7. [(3b) Program to count the number of “scanf” and “printf” statements in a C program. 
Replace them with “readf” and “writef” statements respectively. (lex)](3b)

8. [(4) Program to evaluate arithmetic expressions involving operators +, -, *, /. (lex, yacc)](4)

9. [(5) Program to recognize a valid variable - starts with a letter, followed by any 
number of letters/digits. (lex, yacc)](5)

10. [(6) Program to recognize strings using the grammar (a^n*b^n; n>=0). (lex, yacc)](6)

11. [(7) Program to implement Pass 1 of Assembler. (C)](7)

12. [(8) Program to implement Absolute Loader. (C)](8)

13. [(9) Program to implement FIRST in context free grammar. (C)](9)
14. [(10) Program to implement Shift Reduce Parser for the given grammar:
 E → E+E                 
E → E*E

                                                                                            E→ id     
   (C)](10)

15. [(11) Program to implement code optimization techniques. (C)](11)
