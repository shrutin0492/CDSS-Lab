# Compiler Design and System Software Lab
Programs as part of the Compiler Design and System Software Laboratory course in the 3rd year of my undergrad.

1a. Program to count the number, words, spaces and lines in a given input file.
1b. Program to recognize and count the number of identifiers.
2a. Programs to count the numbers of comments lines in a given C program. Also 
eliminate them and copy the resulting program into separate file.
