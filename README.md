# Compiler Design and System Software Lab
Programs as part of the Compiler Design and System Software Laboratory course in the 3rd year of my undergrad.

1. (1a) Program to count the number, words, spaces and lines in a given input file.

2. (1b) Program to recognize and count the number of identifiers.

3. (2a) Programs to count the numbers of comments lines in a given C program. Also 
eliminate them and copy the resulting program into separate file.

4. (2b) Program to recognize whether a given sentence is simple or compound.

5. (3a) Program to count number of:
i.+ve and -ve integers
ii. +ve and -ve fractions 

6. (3b) Program to count the number of “scanf” and “printf” statements in a C program. 
Replace them with “readf” and “writef” statements respectively.

7. (4) Program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators +, -, *, /.

8. (5) Program to recognize a valid variable which starts with a letter, followed by any 
number of letter or digits.

9. (6) Program to recognize the strings using the grammar (a^n*b^n; n>=0).

10. (7) C program to implement Pass1 of Assembler.

11. (8) C program to implement Absolute loader.

12. (9) C program to implement the FIRST in context free grammar.

13. (10) C program to implement Shift Reduce Parser for the given grammar:
E → E+E
E → E*E
E →(E)
E→ id

14. (11) C program to implement code optimization techniques.
